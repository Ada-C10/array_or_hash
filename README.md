# Array or Hash
How we organize our data matters. Different structuring of data allows for optimizing different algorithms for common methods on the data. Examples of common methods on data include: sorting the data based on a criteria, looking up information for a specific data set, adding data, deleting data etc.

## Exercises
1. Consider the example we looked at with the [Student Account Generator exercise](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/blob/master/learning-to-code/arrays/assignments/account-generator.md) There are various different ways to organize this data. Let's scope our attention down to two options:
<ol>
  <li> as an Array of hashes </li>
  <li> as a Hash of hashes </li>
 </ol>
 Take some time to consider the pros and cons of the above two options.
